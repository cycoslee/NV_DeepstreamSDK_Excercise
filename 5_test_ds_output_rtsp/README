Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Compilation Steps:
  $ cd apps/5_test_ds_output_rtsp/
  $ make
  $ ./test_ds_output_rtsp <uri1> [uri2] ... [uriN]
  ex) $ ./test_ds_output_rtsp file:///opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/streams/sample_720p.h264

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream application that 
You can understand how to implement gstreamer pipeline with deepstream SDK.

It is meant for simple demonstration of how to use the various DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and extract meaningful insights from a video stream.

This example shows how to read multiple videos from URIs and send a tiler view with h264 encoding through RTSP protocol.
Pipeline : multi{ uridecodebin }-> nvstreammux -> nvmultistreamtiler -> nvvideoconvert -> capsfilter -> nvv4l2h264enc -> rtph264pay -> upsink => rtsp_server
(The output rtsp URI will be "rtsp://{localhost}:8554/ds-test")
