Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libx11-dev

Compilation and Execution steps:
  $ cd apps/1_test_ds_input_video/
  $ make
  $ ./test_ds_input_video <h264_elementary_stream>
  ex) $ ./test_ds_input_video /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/streams/sample_720p.h264 

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream application that 
You can understand how to implement gstreamer pipeline with deepstream SDK.

It is meant for simple demonstration of how to use the various DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and extract meaningful insights from a video stream.

This example shows how to decode h264 file and show through a x-window.
Pipeline : filesrc -> h264parse -> nvv4l2decoder -> nvstreammux -> nvegltransform -> nveglglessink
